          The Internet Archive, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, is building a digital
          library of Internet sites and other cultural artifacts in digital
          form. Like a paper library, we provide free access to researchers,
          historians, scholars, people with print disabilities, and the general
          public. Our mission is to provide Universal Access to All Knowledge.
          We began in 1996 by archiving the Internet itself, a medium that was
          just beginning to grow in use. Like newspapers, the content published
          on the web was ephemeral - but unlike newspapers, no one was saving
          it. Today we have 28+ years of web history accessible through the
          Wayback Machine and we work with 1,200+ library and other partners
          through our Archive-It program to identify important web pages.
